# About me 
  <hr />

My name is Sheikyon ―name by which everyone knows me― and I'm an 18-year-old back-end focused programmer with apparently a lot of time to spare with great enthusiasm towards philosophy, history and everything that can be considered a computer. Also, I occasionally board and write about topics of personal interest in my [Substack](https://sheikyon.substack.com/) portfolio.

I consider myself especially skilled at moving around with [Python](https://www.python.org/), [JavaScript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript), [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) + [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/), [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/), [CSS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/CSS/:lang) and [HTML](https://developer.mozilla.org/es/docs/Web/HTML). Not surprisingly, I am currently learning [C++](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C%2B%2B) and [PHP](https://www.php.net/).

# Contact
  <hr />
  * I usually respond quickly on [Telegram](https://t.me/Sheikyon), [Twitter](https://twitter.com/Sheikyon) and Discord <small>(Sheikyon#0001)</small>.
  * If you prefer to send me an email, you can contact me via [sheikyon@sheikyon.nl](mailto:sheikyon@sheikyon.nl).
  * If none of the above alternatives is safe for you or you don't feel comfortable with them, you can contact me by messaging me via XMPP at [sheikyon(at)riseup(dot)net](mailto:sheikyon@riseup.net). I tend to log in sporadically, so don't expect a quick response from me there.
