# Sheikyon

A Jekyll theme based on [Gradfolio](https://github.com/jitinnair1/gradfolio), and adjusted to my banal tastes.

## Local initialization
* Download and install [Ruby](https://https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/), on Ubuntu you can do it with `sudo apt install ruby-full` and in Manjaro first with `sudo pacman -S snapd` to install Snap, then with `sudo snap install ruby --classic` will install Ruby. On Windows you will need to download the [unofficial Ruby installer](https://rubyinstaller.org/).
* Go to the local root of the repository, and if necessary, install the missing dependencies with `bundle install`
* If necessary, also install webrick with `bundle add webrick`
* Launch the Jekyll server with `bundle exec jekyll serve`

Alternatively, you can [download the source files](https://github.com/jitinnair1/gradfolio/archive/master.zip) and make changes locally.
